# **Additional Explanations and Usage Instructions**

## **How to Use This Code**

###**1. Upload Your Image:**

* Place your image file in the same directory as this script or provide the full path to the image file in the `image_path` variable.

* Example: `image_path = /content/my_image.jpg`

### **2. Run the Code:**

* Execute the script in a Python environment like Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE that supports Python.
* The script will load the image, compress it using JPEG, decompress it, and display both the original and reconstructed images.

### **3. Evaluate Results:**

* The script calculates and prints the **PSNR** and **SSIM** values to evaluate the quality of the reconstructed image.
* It also calculates the **compression ratio** , which indicates how much the image has been compressed.

### **4. Adjust Parameters:**

* You can modify the `quantization_matrix` to control the level of compression.
* A higher quantization factor results in greater compression but lower image quality

## **Code Enhancements**

### **1. Intermediate Steps:**

* Added detailed comments and print statements to guide the user through each step of the process.
* Included a function to calculate the **compression ratio** , which provides insight into the efficiency of the compression.

### **2. Performance Metrics:**

* Used `skimage.metrics` to compute **PSNR** and **SSIM** , which are standard metrics for evaluating image quality

### **3. Scalability:**

* The code processes the image in 8x8 blocks, making it scalable for larger images.

## **Expected Output**

* **Original Image:** Displayed as a grayscale image.
* **Reconstructed Image:** Displayed after JPEG compression and decompression.
* **Performance Metrics:**
  * **PSNR:** Measures the quality of the reconstructed image in decibels (dB). Higher values indicate better quality.
  * **SSIM:** Measures structural similarity between the original and reconstructed images. Values closer to 1 indicate better similarity.
* **Compression Ratio:** Indicates how much the image has been compressed. For example, a ratio of `10:1` means the compressed data is 10 times smaller than the original.
